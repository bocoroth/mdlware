OSHW projects

This repo contains my OSHW (Open Source Hardware) projects, generally created using LTSpice (for sims) and KiCad (for board layout). These projects are mostly related to Eurorack synthesizers.

These projects are released under the CERN-OHL-2.0-S license, which means they are free for anyone to use or make derivatives thereof, provided derivatives remain open source (i.e., no proprietary derivatives). See the LICENSE file for more information.
